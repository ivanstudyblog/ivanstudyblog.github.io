# Hello :) Today is Day 355!
A quick summary of today:
* finished the preview of The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act
* learned about keeping history in dbt

## The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act - Chapter 5 - MLOps for High-Risk AI Systems

### AI Act Engineering

The EU AI Act regulates AI systems in the EU to ensure trustworthiness by mitigating risks and safeguarding fundamental rights. Articles 9–15 provide requirements for high-risk AI systems but lack technical implementation guidance. To address this, a quality model for safety-critical AI systems has been proposed, integrating EU AI Act requirements with attributes like ethical integrity, human oversight, and fairness. 

**Key insights**:  

1. Mapping act requirements to quality attributes:  
   - facilitates operationalization of regulatory requirements  
   - integrates compliance into existing practices and aligns with international standards  

2. EU AI act engineering:  
   - a multidisciplinary field combining AI, engineering, data science, law, and ethics  
   - focuses on risk assessment, transparency, monitoring, auditing, documentation, privacy, and human oversight  

3. Integration with CRISP-ML(Q):  
   - aligns AI Act requirements with the six CRISP-ML(Q) phases: business and data understanding, data prep, model engineering, model evaluation, model deployment, and monitoring
   - ensures continuous compliance by addressing risks iteratively throughout the ML lifecycle  

### MLOps and ML Engineering Practices for Achieving Compliance

* establishing a risk management system for the entire lifecycle of the high-risk AI system
* ensuring robust data governance by validating and testing datasets to guarantee their relevance, representativeness, and accuracy for the intended purpose
* creating comprehensive technical documentation to demonstrate compliance and provide authorities with the necessary information for assessment
* designing the hight-risk AI system for aytomatic event recording to identify national-level risks and substantial modifications throughout its lifecycle
* providing detailed instructions for downstream deployers to ensure compliance
* incorporating human oversight capabilities into the design of the high-risk AI system for downstream deployers
* ensuring that the high-risk AI system meets appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity
* establishing a quality management system to guarantee compliance

## DE with dbt - Chapter 13 - Moving Beyond the Basics

### Building for modularity

A quick recap of the Pragmatic Data Platform approach:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cbe1f7c-5264-4bb5-b4e8-ff10be5c6008)

* storage layer: adapt incoming data to how we want to use it without changing its semantics and store all the data: the good, the bad, and the ugly
* refined layer: apply master data and implement business rules
* delivery layer: organize the data to be easy to use, depending on the user

**Modularity in the storage layer**

The storage layer is designed for predictability and modularity, leveraging interchangeable components for flexibility and scalability. Key components include:  

* seed: loads small reference data from csv files, either directly via `ref()` or indirectly using `source()`. Naming conventions like "SEED_xxx" clarify its function
* source definition: references external data, grouping inputs for easier management and auditability while maintaining table name consistency
* snapshot: tracks changes in input entities with periodic snapshots. Limitations include shared resources across environments and dependency on full exports for deletion tracking 
* STG model: integrates components via CTEs. Subcomponents include:  
   - adaptation: prepares incoming data by fixing data types, renaming, and applying corrections
   - default record: adds default values for orphan foreign keys  
   - hashed: calculates keys (HKEY, HDIFF) and metadata columns (e.g, LOAD_TS)  
* HIST model: an insert-only strategy for tracking entity changes, creating a slowly changing dimension type 2 table. This high-performance default stores both current and historical states effectively. Delete-aware variants handle deletions seamlessly
* PII model: separates Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for compliance and controlled access

**Modularity in the refined layer**

The refined layer does not have the same level of predictability as the storage layer, but the general playbook is pretty clear and goes trough these stages:

* refined individual system: the initial process is to compose and transform the data from each individual source system, including the use of locally specific business rules, up to an abstraction level comparable with the other systems
* master data mapping: applying master data transformations to convert the codes from one system to make them interoperable with a wider range of systems
* master data refined layer: the final process is to compose and transform the results of the master data mapping to produce a set of business concepts, expressed with master data codes, that allow us to calculate company-wide business metrics and apply company business rules

Progressive vs direct MD conversion example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fe3e12b-2e52-4b1e-9653-33c37f563184)

There are many different transformations that can be applied, but here is a general overview:

* REF model: the REF model’s role is to represent a refined entity in a certain context, something that you expect to be generally reusable in that context because it represents a concept that is useful and fairly complete in the context
* AGG model: the AGG model’s role is to represent an aggregated refined model
* MDD model: the MDD model’s role is to represent a dimension coming directly from master data, therefore a kind of 'authoritative' list of entities
* MAP model: the MAP model’s role is to represent a mapping table that allows code conversions between one system/context and another
* TR model: the TR model’s role is to represent an intermediate transformation
* PIVOT model: the PIVOT model’s role is to obtain models by pivoting other models

**Modularity in the delivery layer**

When we move to the delivery layer, we have one or more data marts. The role of each data mart is to deliver a dataset related to a specific subject, such as marketing, finance, or operations, at the level of a domain that often matches one organization boundary, such as a plant, country, region, or corporation-wide.

Common models found here:

* FACT model: the FACT model’s role is to represent a Kimball-style fact
* DIM model: the DIM model’s role is to represent a Kimball-style dimension or hierarchy
* REPORT model: the REPORT model’s role is to represent a table that can power a report
* FILTER model: this is a specialized model whose role is to make it extremely clear how one or more facts are filtered based on requirements that exist only in the specific data mart where the filter model lives

### Managing identity

* identifying a key/code to be used to identify one instance of an entity

**Types of keys:**

* surrogate keys
* natural key or business key
* primary key
* foreign key

**Main uses of keys**

* tracking and applying changes
* extracting the current and historical version
* joining data

### Master Data management

Master Data refers to the core descriptive data of an organization, ensuring consistent identification of the same concept across different units. It often overlaps with organizational dimensions like customer, product, or employee.

**Data for Master Data management**

* Master Data Dimensions (MDDs): this is the dimension that contains the 'gold records' of the business concept. Often, there is not a full dimension but only a list of master data codes, maybe with a name or description for human use
* Mapping tables (MAPs): this is a table that allows us to convert the codes from one domain into another – for example, converting Italian product codes into EMEA codes

### Saving history at scale

Before, we used dbt's snapshot feature to track changes to the data. But now the HIST method will be used - _they are simple, efficient, flexible, and resilient and they are the best solution, whether you wish to store the changes, if you want to be able to audit the data that you ingest, or even if you just want to have the current data._

Main advantages of this storage pattern:

* HIST models save version changes using insert-only operations and offer the most simple and scalable way to save your data while keeping all the versions that your data has gone through (insert is the most efficient operation on modern cloud databases, while updates or deletes used by Snapshot have poor performances)

The columnar format is quite good at compressing data, especially for columns with low variability, so our versions will be stored effectively

* HIST tables implement idempotent loads which allow to run and re-run our dbt project
* HIST tables store the changes in a common and flexible way as slowly changing dimensions, allowing to start by using only the current versions, and move to use all the changes in case we need them. There’s no need to reload the data or change how we load/store data if we want to use the stored changes
* even the simplest implementation of the save_history macro provides full auditability of the changes if we receive one change per key per load

**Understanding the save_history macro**

The normal use of the macro is to create HIST models that read data from our STG models and save it.

Example usage for one of the staging tables:

```
{ save_history(
    input_rel = ref('STG_ABC_BANK_POSITION'),
    key_column = 'POSITION_HKEY',
    diff_column = 'POSITION_HDIFF',
) }
```

Here is the outline of the macro:

<img width="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b617c5e9-1707-4043-8324-2b3eac7cc700" />

By not providing a unique_key parameter to the config, we instruct dbt to append all the rows returned by our SQL code to the incremental model.

The  macro’s design is based on the dbt is_incremental() macro to run the right code depending if we already have the underlying table or if we are creating it

_A crucial step of this load pattern is to be sure that, in both the input and the current_from_history, we only have one row for each key. If we have multiple rows, one HDIFF can never match two different ones, so the load will be incorrect. The current_from_history macro satisfies this requirement by design, so we need to ensure that the input is unique by HKEY._

The core of this pattern is to determine what rows from the input need to be inserted into the HIST table. This job is performed by the two versions of the load_from_input CTE – one for the incremental runs and one for the non-incremental ones.

I think this way of adding history uses a different method compared to what I learned in Zach Wilson's bootcamp about implementing SCD type 2. I think that code then was very manual and not designed to use over different pipelines. However, with *this* one it can be used over different pipelines and create a history table. 

**The current_from_history macro**

<img width="807" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4caa5849-dc08-4189-9d0c-76495255e870" />

The heavy lifting is done by the QUALIFY clause, where we partition the data by the desired key and order it by the desired column, in descending order, so that the first row that we keep is the most recent.

Maybe the only interesting param is the qualify_function - it is an optional string that designates the window function used to filter the HIST table

The default value is row_number, which means that the most recent row is returned, based on the key used to partition and the column used to order.

When we use a key with a coarser grain than the data stored in the HIST table, we can use other functions to control what data is retrieved.

As an example, by using the rank() function together with a MONTH(LOAD_TS_UTC) order column, we can retrieve all the changes that were made in the month with the most recent data by each key.

(wow this macro is amazing)

That is all for today!
